<h2> A little bit more about Renee... </h2>
<p>I was born on September 12th, 2001 in Shanghai, China. When it was time to go to middle school, my parents sent me to an international school call YKPAO at rural Shanghai.I spent seven years at YKPAO as a boarding student, I took the International Baccalaureate Diploma during the last 2 years of high school. The IBDP was difficult but I believe it prepared me well for college.I am currently studying at <a href="https://www.oxy.edu/">Occidental College</a> at Eagle Rock, LA.</p>
<p> To know more about me, here's a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FpW5TubEKnhn712X24LGE2mYakJz99WKJVhMIiybd_A/edit?usp=sharing">link<a/> to my <b>resume</b>.</p>
